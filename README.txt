GROUP MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS

We worked on everything together from one computer at a time. While one person 
typed, the other checked syntax and logic and made suggestions to the person 
typing. This allowed us to progress through debugging much faster and generate 
fewer bugs in the process of typing the code. It also helped to work on the 
same code simultaneously when coming up with the heuristic function and 
minimax tree. 

TOURNAMENT IMPROVEMENTS

We first set the value of 'testtingMinimax' to true in player.cpp so that our 
minimax tree would actually be used in the tournament (it was not before).
